                    Fourmilab Anvil Bomb
                       Development Log

2020 February 9

Began development, starting with the current anvil projectile
from the Anvil Tosser product.  This projectile is compatible
with the target, but will have to be modified to act as a
gravity bomb instead of as a thrown projectile.
