[Fourmilab Rocket](https://marketplace.secondlife.com/p/Fourmilab-Rocket/19209433)
is a flying vehicle for the Second Life virtual world which can be used 
to explore anywhere on the Grid accessible from the location in which 
it is rezzed.  You must have land on which you are permitted to rez 
objects or else rez the vehicle in a public sandbox or rez zone.  The
rocket contains an automatic system called "RegionRX" developed by 
Second Life creator 
[Animats][https://marketplace.secondlife.com/stores/207994] which 
recovers from many (but not all) of the calamities which can befall 
vehicles when crossing from one Second Life region to another.

The rocket includes an autopilot which will automatically steer the
target to a destination specified by name or SLUrl, adjusting its
cruise altitude to avoid terrain and, on arrival, automatically landing
at the designated altitude.  The pilot can take over from the autopilot
at any time to avoid obstacles or just look around, with the autopilot
resuming its course after ten seconds.

The rocket can monitor a number of SAM sites, specified by their grid 
co-ordinates (name or SLUrl) and, when the autopilot is engaged, 
automatically plot a course to evade threats (ban lines, prohibited 
parcels, etc.) with the least diversion from a direct course to the 
destination.

Commands, submitted in local chat, permit configuring and operating
the rocket.  These commands may be supplied automatically from scripts
stored in notecards to, for example, perform complex missions with
multiple waypoints.

The rocket may be used a bomber for games.  Anvils may be dropped from
the rocket by touching its body, entering a chat command, or tapping
the FORWARD and BACK control keys simultaneously.  Anvils drop and
leave a temporary impact marker where they hit.  Anvils and impact
markers automatically disappear so they don't create clutter.  (You
must have permission to rez objects in the land above which you drop
an anvil.)

This repository contains all of the software and resources,
including programs in Linden Scripting Language, textures,
notecards, and development documentation, tools, and resources
used the model and its development.  The actual model is built
within Second Life and these components are installed within it.

The
[complete model](https://marketplace.secondlife.com/p/Fourmilab-Rocket/19209433)
is available for free in the Second Life Marketplace.  This
repository contains everything in the model (except the prims,
which are objects built within Second Life), plus additional
resources for developers who may wish to extend or adapt the
model as they wish.  The model is delivered with "full permissions":
those who obtain it are free to copy, modify, and transfer it to
other users within Second Life.
